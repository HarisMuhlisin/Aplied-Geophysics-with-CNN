## ðŸ“– Overview

**Applied Geophysics with CNN** is an endâ€‘toâ€‘end workflow for reservoir characterization in the Amaiha Field (West Natuna Basin). It combines wellâ€‘log petrophysics, seismic inversion, and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) modeling to:
  
- Define facies cutâ€‘offs for clean sand, shalyâ€‘sand, and shale  
- Train & validate a 1D CNN model to predict acoustic impedance  
- Compare inversion results: modelâ€‘based vs. CNN vs. commercial software
