## 📖 Overview

**Applied Geophysics with CNN** is an end‑to‑end workflow for reservoir characterization in the Amaiha Field (West Natuna Basin). It combines well‑log petrophysics, seismic inversion, and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) modeling to:
  
- Define facies cut‑offs for clean sand, shaly‑sand, and shale  
- Train & validate a 1D CNN model to predict acoustic impedance  
- Compare inversion results: model‑based vs. CNN vs. commercial software

## 🔬 Methodology Summary
**Invert seismic data under facies constraints**

- CNN Training & Prediction
- Prepare input features from seismic windows
- Train 1D CNN to map traces → AI
- Validate against blind well data
- Comparative Analysis & Mapping
- Compute RMSE, R² for model‑based vs. CNN
